- K-space -> frequency domain
- RF signal containing echos
- RF signal decomposed into frequency and phase components
- Frequency encoding on x-axis, phase encoding on y-axis
- Traversal of k-space in zig-zag pattern
- EPI refers to the process by which rapid gradient-echo or spin-echo sequences undergo k-space traversal in one or a small number of excitations
    - Single shot vs multi shot EPI
- Refocus and acquire multiple lines of K-space using multiple echos
- Oscillating gradient on readout or Gx axis to encode multiple echos with single TR (repetition time - length of time between RF pulses)
- TE is echo time - length of time between centre of RF pulse to centre of echo
    - Multiple lines with multiple echos (number recovered is ETL or echo train length)
    - Reduces scan time by factor of ETL
    - Encode entire k-space with one RF excitation (single shot EPI) -> Scan Time = TR X NEX (number of excitations) ETL = Ny (number of points in y dimension)
    - Can be done faster with multiple excitations (multi shot EPI) -> Scan Time = TR x Ny / ETL x NEX
        - One segment of k-space per one RF pulse
- Data encoded with bipolar gradient
    - Flyback EPI - readout ONLY on positive lobes
    - Symmetric EPI - readout on positive and negative lobes
- Tesp - Echo Spacing
